# The Art of Lubing Mechanical Keyboard Switches

One of the key aspects of customizing mechanical keyboard switches is the process of lubricating, or "lubing," them. Lubing can greatly enhance the typing experience by reducing friction, improving smoothness, and altering the sound profile of the switch. In this guide, we will explore the different types of switch lube, popular switch sound modifications, and provide an in-depth tutorial on how to properly lube a switch, including the spring.

## Types of Switch Lube

Switch lube comes in various types, each with its own characteristics and effects on the switch's performance. Here are the most common types of switch lube:

### 1. Thin Lube

Thin lube, such as Krytox GPL 205g0 or Tribosys 3204, is used to reduce friction and smooth out the switch's movement. It is applied to the switch housing rails, stem legs, and contact points. Thin lube is ideal for linear switches, as it can make them feel even smoother.

### 2. Thick Lube

Thick lube, like Krytox GPL 205g2 or Tribosys 3203, provides more dampening and is suitable for tactile switches. It is applied to the switch's tactile legs and contact points to enhance the tactile bump while reducing any potential scratchiness.

### 3. Dielectric Grease

Dielectric grease, such as Super Lube or Permatex Dielectric Tune-Up Grease, is a silicone-based lubricant commonly used for stabilizers. It helps reduce rattle and stabilizer noise by providing a smoother and quieter operation.

### 4. Switch Films

Switch films, such as TX Films or Kebo Films, are thin plastic sheets that can be placed inside the switch housing. They help reduce wobble and stabilize the switch's components, resulting in a more consistent and satisfying typing experience.

## Popular Switch Sound Modifications

Lubing can also alter the sound profile of a mechanical keyboard switch. Here are a few popular sound modifications achieved through lubing:

### 1. Thock Sound

"Thock" is a term often used to describe a deep and satisfying sound produced by lubed switches. Achieving the thock sound typically involves using a combination of thick lube, switch films, over lubing, and carefully lubing the switch housing.

### 2. Clack Sound

"Clack" refers to a sharper and crisper sound produced by lubed switches. This sound is often associated with linear switches like Cherry MX Black or Gateron Yellow, lightly lubed with thin lube.

## How to Properly Lube a Switch

Properly lubing a switch involves disassembling it, applying the lube to the necessary parts, and reassembling it. Here is a step-by-step guide on how to lube a switch:

1. **Prepare the necessary tools:** You will need a switch opener, switch lube, a small brush or applicator, a pad to place the components on and to keep the spring from rolling away, and switch films (if desired).

2. **Open the switch:** Use a switch opener to carefully remove the top housing from the bottom housing. Be cautious not to damage the switch components.

3. **Remove the spring:** Take out the spring from the bottom housing and set it aside.

4. **Apply lube to the housing rails:** Using a small brush or applicator, evenly apply a thin layer of lube to the switch housing rails.

5. **Lube the stem legs and contact points:** Apply a small amount of lube to the stem legs and contact points. Be careful not to over-lube, as it may affect the switch's performance.

6. **Optional: Install switch films:** If desired, place switch films inside the switch housing to reduce wobble and stabilize the switch components.

7. **Reassemble the switch:** Carefully place the spring back into the bottom housing, align the stem with the housing, and snap the top housing back into place.

8. **Repeat for all switches:** Repeat the process for each switch in your keyboard.

## The Custom Mechanical Keyboard Community

>>> The world of custom mechanical keyboards is a vast and passionate community. Enthusiasts experiment with different lubes, switch combinations, and modifications to create unique typing experiences. The community thrives on sharing knowledge, discussing sound profiles, and developing new techniques to achieve the perfect keyboard setup. I hope that this place can be a part of this community, not just to share nowledge, but to also bring people that may not have a clue about what they can actually do with keyboards and switches, and give them the oprtunity to enjoy even the littler things in life, well, depending on how much you're using a kayboard ;)

Whether you're looking to improve smoothness, reduce noise, or alter the sound profile of your keyboard switches, lubing is a fascinating aspect of customization that allows you to fine-tune your typing experience to your personal preferences.

Remember, the process of lubing can be time-consuming and requires patience, a good working posture, attention to detail, and good lighting. Take your time, experiment, and enjoy the journey of creating your perfect custom mechanical keyboard setup.

*Note: Lubing switches may void the warranty of your keyboard. Proceed with caution and at your own risk.*
