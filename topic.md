**__Sizes: Mechanical keyboards come in different sizes:__**
* [Full-size:](https://blog.wooting.nl/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Full-size-keyboard-form-factor-min.png) This is the standard layout with a number pad.
* [Tenkeyless (TKL):](https://www.keebtalk.com/uploads/db8059/original/2X/6/6647610ebcb6b7f7028c3cca9e685a902e740c82.png) This layout removes the number pad for a more compact design.
* [60%:](https://www.keebtalk.com/uploads/db8059/original/1X/32e6dc25153a1cc2f4af3fbfca3d21f69aeb7173.png) This layout is very compact, removing the arrow and function keys, usually leaving only the alphanumeric keys.

**__Ergonomics:__**
> Ergonomic keyboards are designed to provide comfort and reduce strain. They may feature [split layouts](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fvoltcave.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2020%2F04%2Fdantambok-superme-mechanical-keyboard.jpg&f=1&nofb=1&ipt=7db6e420911c128b97cab2f959ee324f849a2266c532341aa565288e14fb8ce8&ipo=images), [angled designs](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.boundlessat.com%2Fcore%2Fmedia%2Fmedia.nl%3Fid%3D1195799%26c%3D1281905%26h%3D9adcffe9783e3e69ae8b&f=1&nofb=1&ipt=9f591fc76a8fd69684ef10b729f12a53646a06d4b8005a487a1e47ca070390a2&ipo=images), or [curved key layouts](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fbastardkb.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2021%2F04%2FIMG_0535_transparent-1024x768.png&f=1&nofb=1&ipt=50815142fafb81fe30c24901f38ef7d5a717e98a2943f5d8ff1e80f6a1744f3d&ipo=images) that promote a more natural hand position.

**__Split keyboards:__ **
> Split keyboards physically separate the left and right sides of the keyboard, allowing for more ergonomic positioning to accommodate individual hand placement and reduce strain.

**__Connectivity options:__**
* __Bluetooth:__ Some mechanical keyboards offer wireless connectivity, allowing you to connect to devices without the need for cables. Bluetooth keyboards provide flexibility and portability.
* __Wired:__ Wired keyboards connect directly to a device using a USB-A or USB-C cable, ensuring a stable and reliable connection.

**__Switches:__**
> Mechanical switches are the heart of a mechanical keyboard, determining how the keys feel and sound. Here are some common switch types:
* __Linear:__ Smooth keystrokes without tactile feedback. Examples include [Cherry MX Red](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/VWSCTktPIZ4) and [Gateron Yellow](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/9PxmoIKHGeg).
* __Tactile:__ Provide a tactile bump to indicate key actuation. Examples include Cherry [MX Brown](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/VWSCTktPIZ4) and [Gateron Brown](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/9PxmoIKHGeg).
* __Clicky:__ Offer both tactile feedback and an audible click sound. Examples include [Cherry MX Blue](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/VWSCTktPIZ4) and [Kailh Box White](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/KzxUIQKw9EI).

**__Low profile keyboards:__**
> These keyboards feature a thinner profile and shorter key travel distance, resulting in a sleeker design and potentially quieter typing experience. Examples include the [Keychron K1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZuTxsJ7s1I) and [Logitech G915](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvZQS0mMcVM).

**__Keycaps:__**
> Keycaps can be made from various materials like ABS plastic, PBT plastic, or even custom materials like metal. Different keycap profiles, such as OEM, Cherry, or SA, offer different shapes and heights, affecting the typing experience and ergonomics. Keycaps can also be customized with different colors, designs, or even [artisan keycaps](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Ffeedbeater.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2021%2F01%2Fimage2-1.jpg&f=1&nofb=1&ipt=114470442f2db3098640e5b061b7588789f21afc86f6cba9e3daa9814568c9f9&ipo=images) for aesthetic purposes.
